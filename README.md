## Projects

### 1. Sales Analysis Dashboard

In this project, I utilized MS Excel and SQL to analyze a sales dataset for a retail company. I cleaned and transformed the data to derive meaningful metrics such as sales revenue, profit, and product performance. Then, I created an interactive dashboard using MS Power BI to visualize the key insights and trends.

### 2. Customer Segmentation Study

For this project, I employed SQL and data clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchase behavior. Using unsupervised learning algorithms, I categorized customers into distinct groups, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.

### 3. Financial Performance Analysis

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive financial performance analysis for a company. I used MS Excel to calculate financial ratios, profitability metrics, and growth indicators to assess the company's financial health. The insights gained from this analysis helped in making informed business decisions.
