A bar chart or tree map presents the profitability of each product. This visualization allows you to compare profits across products,
aiding in inventory management and pricing strategies.

A stacked bar chart or area chart displays the total revenue generated each year, segmented by product. This visualization helps you 
identify the highest revenue-generating products over time.

weak sales, enabling you to focus marketing efforts and sales strategies accordingly.
